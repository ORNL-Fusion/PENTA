This version was begun from what was formerly "PENTA2" on 5/19/2010.  This branch will be called PENTA3.

v1.0  -- Begun
v1.1  -- Added option for calculating the inductive flows and fluxes for a unity excitation.  6/8/10
v1.2  -- Fixed bug in calculating the PS fluxes, Added more robust read of ion_params file. 1/6/2011
v1.3  -- Major update 9/22/2011
	*
	* Update to match new documentation.  Improved convolution accuracy and consolidated 
	*  definitions. 
	*
	* Significantly slower (due to more iterations of convoultion integrand) but 
	* much more accurate. -- MBT/T and SN methods now agree well.
	*
     *run_penta.m -- updated exit message, added new flux_cap flag
     *read_pprof_file -- repaced calls to fnder, csaps with mkpp 
      and unmkpp for greater compatibility across matlab licenses 
      (fewer package dependencies)
     *PENTA_main -- Added Bsq as argument to load_DKES_star_files, removed calculation of Xvec,
	  main Er loop now calculates just Flows and Gamma, removed QoT.  Consolidated MBT and 
	  T calls.  
     *load_input_files -- fixed buggy parsing on ion input file
     *load_DKES_star_files -- added B**2 factor to D33 spitzer
     *energy_conv3 -- Changed Kmax to 20, num_K_vals to 10000, 
      default is now logarithmic spacing in K, changed calls to 
      calc_perp_coll_freq for speed.  Removed coefname input.
     *calc_perp_coll_freq -- rewrote to only calculate field component for speed
     *calc_flows_taguchi_v2 -- D33 based coefficients now use logarithmic 
      interpolation, modified equations to match new documentation, changed 
      inversion to left matrix division for accuracy. Simplified arrays/matricies.
     *calc_flows_SN_v2 -- see taguchi flows
	 *calc_flows_DKES -- simplified arrays.  Fixed BUG where D31 coefficient was
	   used instead of D33 for finite applied E_||.  Removed Ts input, added D33*.
	 *calc_flux_DKES -- simplified calls
	 *removed form_Xvec, replaced with form_Avec
	 *Updated flux routines to individual Gamma and QoT routines, consolidated
	   to just MBT and SN routines.
	 *Added simplified convolution routine for calculating PS fluxes.
	 *Added flags for setting integration parameters in run_penta.m and the conv. routines.
