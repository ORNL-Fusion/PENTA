v2.2 (9/9/2009)
-added functions to make/load D* files and calculate L*,M*,N* files internally
-added option for running in "DKES limit"
-BUG: Fixed N* and L* coefficients for Z~=1
-

v2.1 (8/26/2009)
-now works for Smax > 4
-fixed bug in Lmat indexing for Smax>3
-fixed bug that produced error in multi-root cases

v2.0 (8/26/2009)
-rewrote for "arbitrary" truncation in Sonine expansion, this version supports up to 5 terms
-brought more options out to run_PENTA
-rewrote many routines for more transparent looping
-fixed bug in PS flux indexing
-added new parallel flow calculation routine
-added more outputs

v0.9 (7/24/2009)
-fixed minor bug in finding Er roots when roots are too close
-brought more variables out to run_penta.m
-added check for Er=0, which causes DIV0
-added plot for heat fluxes
-removed use of run_penta_condor, run_penta now serves the same purpose
-also modifed JS' condor script to reflect this

v0.8
-added function for calculated PS fluxes
-added PS fluxes to ambipolar fluxes (bug fix)
-replaced csaps fitting of U2 with interp1

v0.7
-added PS fluxes, <U**2> file now required
-added input to run_PENTA_condor for pprof_char
-added roa_vals as an output

INDIVIUDUAL FILE CHANGES
-PENTA.m
**added PS flux calculation, U2 as input
-run_PENTA.m
**added roa_vals as an output
-run_PENTA_condor.m
**added roa_vals as an output
**added pprof_char as an input

-load_LMN_star_files., read_pprof_file.m
**changed path style
-find_Er_roots_PENTA
**see above

v0.6
-added run_PENTA_condor for UW condor runs.  Output is returned from this function.
-Ion parameters (num_ion_species, Z_ion, miopi (ion mass to proton mass ratio) are now read from ion_params namelist file
-modified path calls to use UNIX format, this is still compatible with windows ('\' to '/')
-added check for zero ambipolar roots.  The "ambipolar" Er is then set identically to -1000V/m.  This is a temporary fix.
-If the number of ambipolar roots is not 0,1,3, the first root is chosen, error statement changed to display statement.  This is a temporary fix.

INDIVIUDUAL FILE CHANGES
-run_PENTA.m
**removed ion parameter lines and inputs to surf_loop_PENTA, changed path to UNIX style (compatible with windows)
-surf_loop_PENTA.m
**added lines for reading ion_params file, changed path style
-load_LMN_star_files., read_pprof_file.m
**changed path style
-find_Er_roots_PENTA
**see above
