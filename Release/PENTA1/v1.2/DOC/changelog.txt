v1.2 -- 2008 -- Extensive modifications by JL
This version is a "cleaned up" version of v1.1 where dead code was removed
and kind precision was added to all constants and routines.
Also many comments and small corrections were added.

Notes:
  Inputs
	- Removed former input 7 (ich/ech)
	- Inputs 2 and 3 defining the Er search range can now be either e<a>phi/kT or
	  Er in <V/cm>.  The choice is set by a logical variable at compile time
  Outputs
	- Added kind specification module
	- Added physical constant module
	- All variables, constants declared to double (rknd) precision
  Penta.f
	- Added comments, rearranged code
	- Added logical variable to ignore profile scaling (pedestal option)
	- Minor legend, screen output changes
	- Added catch for infinite loop error
  lijs_subroutine
	- Syntax, I/O structure changed -- now only does single integration by default (removed unused looping options)
	- Added logical variable to use logarthmic interpolation of coefficient database files
	- Reduced spline fit order to 2 (linear)
	- Changed energy integral from x (normalized velocity) to K (normalized energy)
		  - Note this change made clear the error in the old integrand
	- Small changes in definitions of numerical factors
	  - factor of sqrt(2)/pi removed from collision integral
	- Included density in lijs subroutine insread of multiplying it in PENTA program



v1.1  -- 2007-2008 -- Modifications by JL
vmodules_app_sugama.f
  - Added kind specification
lijs_subrotn_ver3.f
  - changed spline order for fitting DKES coeffs to 2 (linear)
	    - See kxord, kyord
            - The cubic spline interpolation was not behaving due to the Er resonance.
  - Changed the coefficient for (lcoef_opt .ge. 4) from 2. to 1. 
	    - See next change
  - Added factor of 2.*xval to fun123 for lcoef_opt == 4 or 5
	    - This factor of 2x was missing from the convolution integral
	    - Note that with the above change the factor of 2 was actually there.  This just adds a bit more transparency.
  - Added subroutine to perform double precision error function (derf) 
	    - Intrinsic to ifort but not most Fortran compilers
penta_8_8_2007.f
  - Added additional output and debugging options (minor)
