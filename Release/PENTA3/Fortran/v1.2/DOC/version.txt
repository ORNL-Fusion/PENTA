* denotes major bug fix

v1.0  -- Initial Fortran release (1/4/2011)
v1.1  -- (1/18/2011)
	 Added convective portion of PS heat flux (usually a small correction).
         Added flows_vs_Er output file.
	 Added check for monotonically increasing cmul, efield in D* files
	 Added check for esmall parameter in fit_coeffs
	 Updated readme files.
*v1.2 -- (2/1/2011)
         Fixed bug where flows(num_Er_test) was used instead of 
         Flows_ambi(:,iroot) when evaluating ambipolar fluxes. Updated 
         documentation. Added parallel current density and contravariant
         flows output file.
